## Hardware Design
### Notes
The Hardware design uses the prebuilt ESP-03 modules for quicker assembly and cost-effectiveness. Since the hardware module is designed to fit into the "Voltek SPEC7188B" and is supposed to be used with a single layer PCB, you will have to solder a connection from the resistor on the top left to CH_PD manually. I also recommend to solder a wire with a length of 12.5cm to the antenna pin of the ESP-03 as a WiFi aerial for better signal reception.
